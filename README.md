[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mediavrog/mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mediavrog/mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/mediavrog/mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta.png?travis)](https://gemnasium.com/mediavrog/mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta)

Extends mongoid_taggable_with_context with support to attach meta information to tags.

Installation
------------

You can simply install from rubygems:

```
gem install mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta
```

or in Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid_taggable_with_context_with_meta'
```

TODO from here

Basic Usage
-----------

To make a document taggable you need to include Mongoid::TaggableOnContext into your document and call the *taggable* macro with optional arguments:

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::TaggableWithContext

  field :title
  field :content

  # default context is 'tags'.
  # This creates #tags, #tags=, #tags_array, #tags_array= instance methods
  # separator is " " by default
  # #tags method returns space separated string
  # #tags= methods accepts space separated string
  # #tags_array method returns an array of tags
  # #tags_array= method accepts an array of tags
  # #tags and #tags_array are automatically synched.
  taggable

  # tagging for 'interests' context.
  # This creates #interests, #interests=, #interests_array, #interests_array= instance methods
  taggable :interests

  # tagging for 'skills' context.
  # This creates #skills, #skills=, #skills_array, #skills_array= instance methods
  # changing tag separator to "," (Default is " ")
  taggable :skills, :separator => ','
end
```

Then in your form, for example:

```rhtml
<% form_for @post do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :title %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :content %><br />
    <%= f.text_area :content %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :tags %><br />
    <%= text_field_tag 'post[tags]' %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :interests %><br />
    <%= text_field_tag 'post[interests]' %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :skills %><br />
    <%= text_field_tag 'post[skills]' %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </p>
<% end %>
```

Aggregation Strategies
----------------------

By including an aggregation strategy in your document, tag aggregations will be automatically available to you.
This lib presents the following aggregation strategies:

* MapReduce
* RealTime

The following document will automatically aggregate counts on all tag contexts.

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::TaggableWithContext

  # automatically adds real time aggregations to all tag contexts
  include Mongoid::TaggableWithContext::AggregationStrategy::RealTime

  # alternatively for map-reduce
  # include Mongoid::TaggableWithContext::AggregationStrategy::MapReduce

  field :title
  field :content

  taggable
  taggable :interests
  taggable :skills, :separator => ','
end
```

When you include an aggregation strategy, your document also gains a few extra methods to retrieve aggregation data.
In the case of previous example the following methods are included:

```ruby
Post.tags
Post.tags_with_weight
Post.interests
Post.interests_with_weight
Post.skills
Post.skills_with_weight
```

Here is how to use these methods in more detail:

```ruby
Post.create!(:tags => "food,ant,bee")
Post.create!(:tags => "juice,food,bee,zip")
Post.create!(:tags => "honey,strip,food")

Post.tags # will retrieve ["ant", "bee", "food", "honey", "juice", "strip", "zip"]
Post.tags_with_weight # will retrieve:
# [
#   ['ant', 1],
#   ['bee', 2],
#   ['food', 3],
#   ['honey', 1],
#   ['juice', 1],
#   ['strip', 1],
#   ['zip', 1]
# ]
```

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
